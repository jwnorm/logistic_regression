# Generalized Linear Regression

> **Note:** This repo is related to my third homework assignment for ISE537 at NC State University.

## Overview

This project is focused on generalized linear regression, specifically logistic regression. The data for this project is employment data that documents several different characteristics of employees. All fields are numerical.

The primary aim is to fit multiple models and try to predict the probability that an employee stays at their job given the available fields. This includes sections related to:

-   Model fitting
-   Statistical Inference
-   Goodness of Fit
-   Prediction
